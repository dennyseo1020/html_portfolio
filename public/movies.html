<h3>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</h3>
<p>A comedy show following the journey of the Ninety-Ninth precinct with detectives Jake Peralta, Captain Raymond Holt and more. It is strongly recommended for its light and casual mood, perfect for a relaxing night. But also with emotional ups and downs, tackling highly relevant social issues, such as racism, police brutality, and gender identification.</p>
